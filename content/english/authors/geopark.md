Our themed guesthouse was established as a geopark model project to showcase the values of the Bükk-vidék UNESCO Global Geopark in a truly special location in the center of Bükkszentkereszt. Our accommodation is also easily accessible by public transport. It is an ideal venue for couples seeking nature, family events, corporate team-building programs, class reunions, wedding anniversaries, and even smaller forest weddings.

### Services of the Geopark Guesthouse

In the Geopark Guesthouse, we can provide accommodation for a total of 28 guests in 6 double rooms, 2 quadruple rooms, and 2 quadruple apartments with private kitchens. Every room has an en-suite bathroom with a shower and a private terrace, and the windows overlook the Bükk Mountains, offering a unique view to our visitors.

For communal spaces, we offer our dining room, which can accommodate 24 people, and our spacious, bright living room overlooking the garden. Our dining room is also an ideal venue for smaller workshops and gatherings. The comfort of our living room is ensured by a sofa, armchairs, and a small house library.

A kitchenette is available on each floor, equipped with a microwave oven, coffee maker, toaster, and kettle. An outdoor fire pit has also been set up in the yard, so our guests can make their time at our accommodation even more enjoyable with bacon roasting, cooking in a "bogrács" (a Hungarian cauldron), and grilling. The necessary tools (skewers, bogrács) and firewood are provided on-site free of charge.

For families with small children, we provide a high chair, a travel cot, and a baby bath for free, and children can run around carefree in the enclosed yard.

Our guesthouse is dog-friendly; we welcome pets for a fee. However, guests with allergies need not worry, as dogs are only allowed in designated rooms.

The accommodation is self-catering; restaurants, a small grocery store, a pharmacy, and a post office are located within easy reach in the village. (Food delivery is also possible.)

### What was the guesthouse named Geopark?

The Bükk-vidék Geopark was established in 2017, and by now, 109 municipalities have joined the initiative, including Bükkszentkereszt. The aim of the geopark is to present the geological values of the region, to develop programs based on these values that strengthen the local economy, to reinforce local identity, and to support local businesses built on natural assets.

Accordingly, the decoration of our guesthouse rooms was inspired by the natural treasures of the Bükk-vidék UNESCO Global Geopark.
