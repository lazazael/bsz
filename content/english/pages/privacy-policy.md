The Bükk National Park Directorate (“BNPI”), which operates the www.bnpi.hu website, attaches the utmost importance to the security of personal data obtained from the use of this website. We place great emphasis on the protection of your personal data. This privacy statement sets out the information we hold about how we handle such data. Please note that you can voluntarily give BNPI your consent to process your personal data.

#### Data collection

You can use our website without disclosing your personal data. Your personal information is not required to use our website, unless it is necessary for us to provide you with further information at your request. When you use our website, we store data on our servers for various security reasons. Such data may include the name of your internet service provider, the name of the website from which you accessed our site, the websites you visit from our site and your IP address. This data may also be used to identify you, but we do not use it for such purposes. From time to time we may use the data for statistical purposes, but we will maintain the anonymity of each user so that the individual cannot be identified. In the event that we make your personal data available to others within BNPI to obtain the information you request, we will ensure compliance with the appropriate data protection standards by technical and organisational means.

#### Collection and processing of your personal data

We will only collect personal data if you provide it to us with your consent to the collection of the data, at the time of registration, when filling in forms or sending us emails, in connection with questions or requests about products, or for other reasons where you have chosen to provide us with this information.

Your personal data will remain with BNPI as the data controller. Your personal data will not be disclosed to third parties or transferred outside the EEA in any form without your express written consent, unless you have given us permission or unless required by law.

If part of the data processed by BNPI is stored on computers that are not under Hungarian jurisdiction and whose data protection laws may differ from Hungarian rules, in such cases we will ensure that the stored data is adequately protected at the place of storage in accordance with Hungarian regulations.

#### Purposes of use

Unless otherwise required by law, we will use the information we collect only to provide you with the information you request or for other purposes that you authorise. If you register on our site, by registering you agree to our website privacy policy and consent to receive information, newsletters or DM messages from us about the website, our company, our products, to request information from you to improve our services or to ask you to participate in market research.

#### Children

The protection of children's personal data is of the utmost importance, therefore we do not collect, process or use any data from persons under the age of 18 known to us on our website without the prior verifiable consent of their legal guardian. The legal guardian has the right to view and/or request the deletion of information provided by the child upon request.

#### Contact us

If you have any questions, suggestions or objections, please contact BNPI using any of the contact details in the imprint. As the Internet continues to evolve, we may need to amend our privacy policy from time to time. We reserve the right to make unilateral changes where necessary.

#### Photos and videos

There is nothing in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that prohibits people from taking photos in a public place. Provided you are not harassing anyone, taking photographs of people in public is generally allowed and most likely will qualify for the household exemption under Article 2(2)(c) of the GDPR.

However, what you do with that photo can potentially become a data protection issue, for example, if the photograph, which contained the personal data of individuals, was sold for commercial gain or was posted publicly on a social media account. Under those circumstances, you are likely to be considered a data controller which brings with it a host of obligations and duties under data protection law. In particular, it would be necessary for you to demonstrate, amongst other things, your lawful basis for the processing of such personal data under Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
