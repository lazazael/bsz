#### Children

The protection of children's personal data is of the utmost importance, therefore we do not collect, process or use any data from persons under the age of 18 known to us on our website without the prior verifiable consent of their legal guardian. The legal guardian has the right to view and/or request the deletion of information provided by the child upon request.

#### Contact us

If you have any questions, suggestions or objections, please contact BNPI using any of the contact details in the imprint. As the Internet continues to evolve, we may need to amend our privacy policy from time to time. We reserve the right to make unilateral changes where necessary.

#### Photos and videos

There is nothing in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that prohibits people from taking photos in a public place. Provided you are not harassing anyone, taking photographs of people in public is generally allowed and most likely will qualify for the household exemption under Article 2(2)(c) of the GDPR.

However, what you do with that photo can potentially become a data protection issue, for example, if the photograph, which contained the personal data of individuals, was sold for commercial gain or was posted publicly on a social media account. Under those circumstances, you are likely to be considered a data controller which brings with it a host of obligations and duties under data protection law. In particular, it would be necessary for you to demonstrate, amongst other things, your lawful basis for the processing of such personal data under Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
