{{< accordion "Hor Valley" >}}
On the road from Cserépfalu to Bükkszentkereszt, on the Hor Valley road, opposite the Long Valley, there is a geological base section showing the formations of the Raven's Roost Member of the Upper Triassic Upper Tarn Limestone Formation. The Hollóstető Limestone of the formation is a light grey flinty limestone with interbeds of 1-20 cm marble between 10-30 cm limestone beds. Slight metamorphism has resulted in a controlled fabric and recrystallization of the parent material.

{{< accordion "Great-field" >}}
There are very few really beautiful and species-rich mountain meadows in our country. One of them is the Great Meadow of the Bükk, which stands out as a “sanctuary” among them all. Its importance is underlined by the fact that 5 protected and 77 protected plant species occur in its grassland communities. It can be said that there is hardly a square metre of the meadow where there is no protected plant species.

{{< accordion "Hornbeam Valley Glasshouse - Cellar" >}}
In 1834, the founder of the glassworks in the Hornbeam Valley was József Schir, who bought the equipment from the widow of the founder of the glassworks in the turnip field, József Struller. He rented a plot of land of more than 11 acres in the Hornbeam Valley from the crown estate of Diósgyőr and built the factory there. The glass production here was already a factory product: employing hired labour, operating steam engines and participating in commercial capital production. His memory is still preserved in his cemetery, where the foundations of several buildings were found during archaeological excavations carried out by the Herman Ottó Museum at Miskolc in 2001. A roof was built over the foundations of a worker's house, and an exhibition can be seen on the floors underneath. Next to it, the site of a former glassworks waste dump (halna) is marked by dense glass debris.
